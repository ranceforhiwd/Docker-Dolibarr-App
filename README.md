<h3>Dockerized Dolibarr w/ MariaDB and Webserver</h3>

This project is useful for developers exploring the Dolibarr API in a docker container.  The network also has a separate webserver for applications development and communcations with Dolibarr for business entity data.  Developers can use this network as a testbench for api calls and application data exchanges. 

The application container serves a webpage form to collect end-user data, then pass data with parameters to Dolibarr.  A return page is provided with information about the processing of data sent via the form.  Javascript is used as a frontend for the application alone with some minor CSS.
